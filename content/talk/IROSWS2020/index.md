title: Parameter Optimization for Loop Closure Detection in Closed Environments
event: IROS 2020 - Virtual Conference
event_url: https://www.iros2020.org/
location: Las Vegas, USA
summary: A workshop talk about how meta-parameters, required for most mapping algorithms, can be learned.
abstract: "Tuning parameters is crucial for the performance of localization and mapping algorithms. In general, the tuning of the parameters requires expert knowledge and is sensitive to information about the structure of the environment. In order to design truly autonomous systems the robot has to learn the parameters automatically. Therefore, we propose a parameter optimization approach for loop closure detection in closed environments which requires neither any prior information, e.g. robot model parameters, nor expert knowledge. It relies on several path traversals along the boundary line of the closed environment. We demonstrate the performance of our method in challenging real world scenarios with limited sensing capabilities. These scenarios are exemplary for a wide range of practical applications including lawn mowers and household robots.  \n \n
