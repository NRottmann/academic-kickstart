abstract: "MIRANA - the mobile intelligent robot agent for navigation and assistance \n \n

Robots and autonomous intelligent systems have an ever-increasing influence on various areas of life. For example, they are used in industry, logistics, medicine, or increasingly in the private sector. \n \n

In this lecture we present MIRANA (Mobile Intelligent Robotic Agent for Navigation and Assistance). A self-propelled language assistant that can be used as a navigation aid for existing specialist staff in clinics, nursing homes and homes for the elderly, but also in the retail trade. \n \n

MIRANA is based on three main components: the Robot Operating System (ROS), a deep learning model (Tensorflow) for Hotword-detection and the Watson Assistant.
ROS coordinates and controls the components needed for navigation and scheduling. Hotword-detection ensures that the robot recognizes when it is being addressed offline, i.e. without a connection to the Internet. A connection to the Watson Assistant is then established. The Watson Assistant is a cloud-based assistance system that captures customer/patient requests via spoken language, processes them intelligently and responds accordingly. \n \n

In this talk you will get an overview of the relevant topics which are necessary for the development of the presented robot assistant. \n \n
