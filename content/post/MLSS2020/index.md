I had the opportunity to attend the MLSS 2020. I got a lot of interesting insights into the different fields of Machine Learning such as Causality, Fairness, Reinforcement Learning and many more. Most of the lectures hold during the summer school are available at YouTube. For further information, just visit the [website](http://mlss.tuebingen.mpg.de/2020/).
