During the Healthcare Hackathon 2019 in Berlin (02. - 03. September), we had the opportunity to present our MIRANA project to a broad audience and to the Minister for Healthcare, Jens Spahn. The Hackathon was organized by the Universit√§tsklinikum Schleswig-Holstein (UKSH) und der Unimedizin Mainz (UM) together with the Federal Ministry for Healthcare. Around 20 groups attended and developed their ideas in the area of healthcare. Thereby they worked on a broad range of applications, for example smartphone applications or robotic systems. We presented the recent achievements for our MIRANA project (http://www.rob.uni-luebeck.de/mirana/).
