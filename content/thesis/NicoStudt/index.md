## Abstract
The focus of this work is on extending the functionality of the robot platform
Loomo. Using cartography and navigation methods, the basis for an autonomous system is created. In addition, the recognition and storage of AR
markers simplifies human-robot interaction by enabling targeted navigation
to specific locations. The implementation of the used software components
ROS, Movebase, RTAB-Map and ALVAR is described in detail and tested in
an experimental setting.
